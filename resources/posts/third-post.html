            Identity & Records
            When you go to a new country, or even a new state, your identity does not follow you. 
            Cardano uses the blockchain to store your identity. And because the blockchain is global, 
            your ID and personal records are available wherever you go.

            Imagine a world where the same drivers license that works for you in Texas, 
            also works in Sierra Leone. And the same goes for educational achievements, 
            professional credentials, and medical records.
