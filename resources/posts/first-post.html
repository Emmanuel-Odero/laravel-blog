            Cardano has a digital currency called ADA. You can use ADA to buy food and services where accepted. 
            You can also trade ADA for local currency, as you might exchange US Dollars for Euros. 
            One way that ADA works better than traditional currencies is that it is easy, fast, 
            and cheap to send it anywhere in the world. It is also accessible and secure, 
            so that even areas of the world without reliable banking can use it.
